# Flow Control Statements in Java

This repository contains examples of flow control statements in Java, created in response to a task from Wipro. Flow control statements are essential components of any programming language, and they enable you to make decisions and control the execution flow of your code. In Java, these statements include **if-else**, **switch**, **while**, **for**, and **do-while** loops.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- **if-else Statements:** This section showcases how to use conditional statements to make decisions in your Java programs.

- **Switch Statements:** Explore how to use the switch statement for multi-way branching based on different values of an expression.

- **While Loops:** Learn about the while loop, which repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition is true.

- **For Loops:** Discover how the for loop can be utilized to iterate a specific number of times.

- **Do-While Loops:** Explore the do-while loop, which is similar to the while loop but guarantees the execution of the loop's block at least once.

Each section contains code examples and explanations to help you understand the concepts and apply them effectively in your Java projects.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flow-control-statements-java.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired section's directory:
   ```
   cd flow-control-statements-java/if-else
   ```

3. Open the Java files in your preferred IDE or text editor to examine the code examples.

4. Compile and run the Java files to see the flow control statements in action.

Feel free to explore, modify, and build upon these examples to enhance your understanding of flow control statements in Java.
